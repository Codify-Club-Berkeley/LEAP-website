# LEAP-website

LEAP is a program that helps struggling homeless and foster youth connect with high school student tutors to help them succeed in school. 

Our team in Codify is building a single centralized application (website) to manage LEAP's members. Prospective tutors can create an account and apply directly through the website, and admin can view tutor applications, and admit or deny them directly through the website. This reduces the need for an external database or external communications through email.

Students will also be able to make a profile, or have a profile made for them by an administrator. The matching algorithm will find the best tutor and student pairings automatically. 

The messaging system will remove the need for sharing private phone numbers or email addresses among students, tutors, parents, and teachers.
